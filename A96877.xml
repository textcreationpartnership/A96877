         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In his declining days, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies exerciſed him with ſore afflictions, of bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſpirituall combates, and conflicts, and ſoking, and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtempers of the ſtone in the bladder, with Apoplexies, and Palſie, and other infirmities of age; but O the ſweet and invince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able patience!

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I do much bleſs God for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiginous times; when ſo many reeds have been ſhaken with every wind; ſo I am confident, you will ever bleſs God, for that your houſe was built upon the Rock: and<pb facs="tcp:121321:19"/> for the excellencies of Chriſt, and of his attractive loves to your ſoul: who made you ſick of love, after the more full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, who is a head of fine gold, and a Cluſter of Camphere: the Lord your righteouſneſs; the chief of ten thouſand: who hath invited you to repentance unto life, and to more daily communion with his excellency. Pardon my boldneſs Gracious SIR, poſſibly God will uſe my little Talent, to warm your heart, with the ſhining love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: ſo peerleſs, ſo ſweet, ſo chaſt, ſo full, ſo unchage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo adequate, and magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, in all his Mediatoriall
<pb facs="tcp:121321:19"/> works upon your ſoul, I ſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſoul, ſo miraculouſly ſaved by the Lord: and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the ſuburbs of Hell, ſo unexpectedly, ſo undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, ſo freely, in the day of your ſouls firſt love, &amp; eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to his bleſſed ſelf. Time was (Noble SIR) that your Honour walked in the way of your own heart, bathed and rolled in a worldly Paradiſe of princely favour, when your thoughts, were too much (I preſume) taken up about ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionalls: with which to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amell your preſent ſtate, with worldly contentments: whoſe emptineſs, together with your Chriſtleſſeneſs, the God and
<pb facs="tcp:121321:20"/> Father of all your mercies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in his own time, to that your pretious ſoul, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, did let down ſome beams and glimpſes of the <hi>unum neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium,</hi> more neceſſary then to be born, to live, to be fed, and clad: I mean Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified: when heavens infinite mercy, cauſed the day to break, and the ſhadows to flye away: preſently upon which you muſt confeſs with godly <hi>Junius, ſtatim mihi alio facies apparuit:</hi> when you then heard with other ears, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with another intellect, ſaw with other eyes, ſpake another language, and with a new tongue, read the Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:121321:20"/> with another ſpirit, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with another ſenſe, and underſtanding: yea, and acted by other principles then before, <hi>old things then vaniſhed away, &amp; all things became new;</hi> But how? I anſwer, by that power of God, that exceeding greatneſs of power, which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and ſet him at the right hand of God. SIR! thus you came to know Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified, which is above all knowledge, eſpecially to know our ſelves to be Crucified with him; Oh! that is wiſedom indeed, and knowledge moſt tranſendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent: for it will make a man wiſe to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beſides,<pb facs="tcp:121321:21"/> thus to know Chriſt, and thus to know him for our ſelves, is of moſt excellent uſe to us at preſent, ſince it is not onely an informing, and ſpeculative knowledge, but a conforming and reforming, a practicall and operative knowledge, which works mightily on the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part: perſwading that alſo (by degrees) to bee Crucified with Chriſt, and to live more intirely by the faith of the Son of God, who loved us, and gave himſelf for us. (Pretious ſoul) this life by faith, is life indeed, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life naturall is a death to this life, but the believers ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, that is a life purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:121321:21"/> at the deareſt rate, <hi>viz.</hi> by the moſt unvaluable blood of Chriſt. It's to live in God the Father ſpiritually, to live in Jeſus Chriſt by the myſticall union, and by the ſanctifying Spirit of God; breathing this life into dead ſouls, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening our dead &amp; dry bones, enabling &amp; impowering us, to cry Abba Father by the Spirit of his Son: and looſing the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tongue, to ſay from our own particular intereſt, <hi>O Lamb of God which takeſt away my ſins;</hi> all my ſins: the ſins of all my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:121321:22"/> Jeſus, as freely as ever the rain did fall, or the Sun did ſhine, never to impute any one of them to me, but acquitting and abſolving thy poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, meerly for thy mercies ſake: to juſtifie me for ever, before the eyes of thy glory; nor is this all, (O Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſays the pardoned ſoul) but thou doſt alſo richly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate thy poor ſervant, to be the beloved Spouſe of thy deareſt Son: and to confer that grace of Adoption, to bring me nigh to thy ſelf, by the blood of Chriſt: yea to confer ſanctification on mee, that I might alſo partake of thy divine nature; of a Briar, to

               <hi>In the words be two parts.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt he propoſeth the large deſire of his ſoul, as if he had ſaid, Lord long have I lived, and have ſeen all the Vanity that is under the Sun;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121321:29"/> and thought I could never have my fill: But now Lord, ſince thou haſt made me ſee the emptines of the creature, &amp; thy fulnes; why do I live any longer in ſuch a place as earth is?

            <p>So now he deſires death, which is <hi>reſolutio animae a corpore,</hi> (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call death,) who ſay that there is a ſtrong ligament between the ſoul, and the body, which death doth unty; and ſo deliver up the perſon either to a better,<note place="margin">Qui paca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum habent Deum, et pacatam conſcientiam illi in pace moriuntur.</note> or worſe place.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121321:29"/> So he deſiers to die in an holy calme, and ſweet peace.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the propoſall, next briefly of the Confirmation.</p>

            <p>Thoſe ſacred Virgins who in the ſack of <hi>Rome,</hi> choſe to prevent the barbarous heathen, proſtituting their bodies to uncleanneſſe, by a volunta-murthering of themſelvs, had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all; nor ought they under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence, have fled unto ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a prevention, this but by the way.</p>
            <p>They alone, who have had a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſpect upon the Lord, can bee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121321:33"/> rightly willing to dye: they who have ſo looked into the promiſe, that they are aſſured, God will ſhew them their Lord, firſt believingly, and then bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifically, do alſo look upon death (which was wont to be ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) as very much changed: for now, death is no longer a deſtroyer, but a deliverer: no longer a puniſhment, or a curſe, but a bleſſing: yea death to a bliever, is one legacy in that rich In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>

            <p>We cannot ſee Chriſt in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiality with the Father, and with the Holy Ghoſt: Such a ſight of God here below, would be inconſiſtent with a mortall and ſublunar beeing, and would ſwallow up the Creature man: as the Schoolmen do affirm.

               </note>St. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth well anſwere this, and the like objections, ſaying, we can ſee no more of God, and of Chriſt then God ſhall pleaſe to manifeſt unto us, or then Chriſt ſhall pleaſe to reveale unto us; as he did to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God did put him in a clift of the Rock:<note place="margin">Exod. 33.22.23.</note> what breaking forth of his glory the Lord ſhal pleaſe to diſcover unto us, finite creatures, thoſe we may ſee.<note place="margin">Viſione in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibili videntar ea quae ſunt à nobis intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibilia. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> But the Father goes on further, we may ſee much of God with our intellect, (I meane) of ſuch things, as are intelligible; and thus many things of God, and Chriſt, do fall within our capacity, and as we are able to bear them; thus viſions be ſome darker, ſome more lightſome, ſome perſons have more day, and ſome more night; yet, at the beſt, our ſight here, is but

                  <note place="margin">1 Modera.</note>To the firſt, The Scriptures bid you mourn, but moderately, you may bee much affected, but manage it wiſely; the two ſiſters of <hi>Lazarus</hi> did mourn, but with good mediocrity, for they <hi>knew he ſhould riſe again;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 11.24.</note> and our

               <p>Again, a Saint never dyes, but (in a ſenſe) God wants him, and hee whom God gave to be ſuch a friend, the ſame God takes him again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee needs him; you will ſay you have need he ſhould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved longer: but whoſeneed muſt take place, yours or God's? yours, to whom ſuch a friend was lent ſo long? or God's need, whoſe hee was? who muſt, and will have him nearer to himſelf, in a more celeſtiall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that to all eternity; you muſt ſuffer this conſideration to alter
